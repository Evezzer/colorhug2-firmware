1.1.3	2012-01-26	colorhug-1.1.3.bin
	 * You need to update to colorhug-client >= 0.1.5 to read the
	   new style metadata information.
1.1.0	2012-01-18	colorhug-1.1.0.bin
	 * Do not lock up the device if the host crashes mid-read. This
	   should also fix using the device in HID mode which is needed
	   for driver-less operation in Windows and OSX.
	 * Make the black readings more precise by waiting for the first
	   pulse before starting the timing loop and use the integral
	   period up until the last rising edge. This should remove
	   the small color tints for very low light readings.
1.0.3	2011-12-26	colorhug-1.0.3.bin
	 * Always use the factory XYZ calibration as well as the ccmx
	   matrix when getting readings.
	 * Allow setting the lost-or-stolen flag when in firmware mode.
1.0.2	2011-12-09	colorhug-1.0.2.bin
	 * Return the correct error if the EEPROM unlock code was
	   incorrect.
	 * Add a new command GetHardwareVersion.
	 * Multiply the dRGB values by the post-scale before using the
	   calibration matrix.
1.0.1	2011-11-30	colorhug-1.0.1.bin
	 * Add calibration remapping functionality to be able to specify
	   default matrixes for LCD, CRT and projectors.
	 * Use a better packed float multiplication algorithm to improve
	   XYZ measurement accuracy.
	 * Add a calibration matrix display type bitfield to each
	   calibration record so the user can't match LCD matrices to
	   projectors and vice versa.
1.0.0	2011-11-24	colorhug-1.0.0.bin
	 * Initial firmware release
